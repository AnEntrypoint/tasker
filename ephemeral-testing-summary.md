# Ephemeral Call System Testing Summary

## Current Status

- We've successfully created test tasks and published them to the database
- We've created test scripts to verify the ephemeral call behavior 
- We've implemented a tool to check stack runs in the database

## Findings

1. Currently, tasks are executing synchronously without using the ephemeral call queueing system
2. Calls to `tools.tasks.execute()` in our tasks are not being intercepted by the system
3. The stack_runs table contains various completed and processing entries, but none for our new test tasks
4. No task_runs records are being created for our test task executions

## Possible Issues

1. The QuickJS environment may not be properly intercepting and saving nested calls to the stack_runs table
2. The __saveEphemeralCall__ function in QuickJS might not be correctly implemented or connected
3. The VM state isn't being saved when nested calls are encountered
4. The stack processor might not be processing pending stack runs correctly

## Next Steps

1. **Investigate QuickJS Configuration**:
   - Check the QuickJS executor implementation in supabase/functions/quickjs/index.ts
   - Verify that promise handling is correctly implemented with newAsyncContext()
   - Ensure that tools.tasks.execute is being properly intercepted

2. **Verify Database Setup**:
   - Check the stack_runs and task_runs table schemas
   - Ensure proper indexes are set up for efficient querying

3. **Check Ephemeral Call Implementation**:
   - Verify the implementation of __saveEphemeralCall__ in the QuickJS environment
   - Check how VM state is being saved when nested calls are encountered

4. **Test Stack Processor**:
   - Manually create a stack_run record and see if it gets processed
   - Verify database triggers are set up correctly

## Implementation Tasks

1. **QuickJS Executor Enhancement**:
   - Implement proper interception of tools.tasks.execute calls
   - Ensure VM state is correctly saved when nested calls are encountered

2. **Task Execution Workflow Update**:
   - Modify executeTask function to create task_runs records
   - Return task run IDs immediately rather than waiting for results

3. **Stack Processor Improvements**:
   - Enhance the stack processor to handle nested calls efficiently
   - Implement better error handling and recovery
   
4. **Testing Utilities**:
   - Create additional test tasks with different levels of nesting
   - Implement better monitoring and diagnostic tools

## Recommended Testing Steps

1. Manually create a stack_run record for testing
2. Monitor the stack processor behavior using check-stack-runs.js
3. Validate the ephemeral call queueing through simple test tasks
4. Test more complex nested call patterns once basic functionality is working
