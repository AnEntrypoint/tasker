Continue with the debugging and fixing process for the Gmail search task. Before declaring the work complete, you must demonstrate a successful end-to-end test that meets all these specific criteria:

1. **Complete System Startup**: Successfully start Supabase with the optimized edge runtime configuration (per_worker policy) and all edge functions running without Docker issues

2. **Task Code Deployment**: Verify the corrected comprehensive-gmail-search task code (without try-catch blocks around external API calls) is properly published to the task_functions table in the database

3. **Full Workflow Execution**: Run a complete Gmail search test that successfully progresses through all phases:
   - Domain discovery using admin.domains.list
   - User enumeration for each domain using admin.users.list  
   - Gmail message search for each user using gmail.users.messages.list
   - Message detail retrieval using gmail.users.messages.get
   - Final result aggregation with proper data structure

4. **Resource Management Verification**: Confirm the optimized simple-stack-processor with throttling and adaptive processing intervals prevents WORKER_LIMIT/HTTP 546 errors

5. **Suspend/Resume Validation**: Verify that external API calls properly trigger suspend/resume mechanism without being caught by try-catch blocks, allowing TASK_SUSPENDED exceptions to bubble up correctly

6. **Result Quality Check**: Ensure the final output contains:
   - Non-empty domains array with actual Google Workspace domains
   - Non-empty users array with real user accounts
   - Non-empty messages array with actual Gmail message data including subjects, senders, dates
   - Proper summary statistics showing total domains, users, and messages found

7. **No Manual Intervention**: Confirm the entire process runs automatically without requiring manual stack run triggers or error recovery

Do not consider the task complete until you can demonstrate a working end-to-end execution that produces meaningful Gmail search results from real user accounts across multiple domains, with all stack runs completing successfully and no resource exhaustion errors.
